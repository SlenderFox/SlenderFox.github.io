    <p>I am fluent in and have formal education in C++ and C#. <br>
      I have used personal time to educate myself in the basic syntax 
      of Python and have developed small games and applications in it. 
      I have had exposure to html, css and javascript (came in handy 
      when making this website). <br>
      I would love to learn new languages if needed. </p>
